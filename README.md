# Abstract

The Book Matching System is designed to make it easy for students to select a book for a college course, as well as make it easy for professors to add books with tailored reviews and information. Professors enter books into their particular course, including relevant information about the book including reading lexile level, number of pages, main character attributes, etc. Students enter information about the type of book they would like to select including information about the same book characteristics described above. A list of books is then generated starting with the most suitable books for the students interests, from which they can select a title to read for the course.
